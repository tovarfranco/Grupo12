This readme describes the usage of this project and all the requirements to run it.

#  React App

Here you will find the steps to run this React project.

### Installation üîß

Follow this steps:

1. Download the backend project beforehand as it contains the necessary APIs (read backend README.md for more information) 
2. Download or clone this project (entire repository) to your local disk.
3. Move to this folder (Project/frontend).
4. Open the command prompt (cmd, bash or VSC). For development you can open the folder in VSC with cmd or bash using: ```code .``` 
5. Install the dependencies running this command:
    ```npm install```

### Run üéÆ
7. To start the aplication run: ```npm start``` (will ask you to use another port as backend project is using port 3000)
8. Go to the webrowser and enjoy (uses port **3001**):
    - http://localhost:3001/ (index page)
9. You can use the {user: admin@hotmail.com, password: admin123} to use the website as a valid user.
10. To stop the execution, use: ```Ctrl + C```

*Note: frontend project uses port 3001 as 3000 is used by this backend project.*

### Production üîó

* Website: https://roostermusic.net/ (backend project, read backend README.md for more information)
* Dashboard: https://dashboard.roostermusic.net/ (frontend project)

*Note: these are the current websites. The domain could change or expire. Hosted in AWS.*

### ***React README.md (generated automatically when app is created):***

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
